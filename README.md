WHAT'S NEW? Add redux, react-router, JS->TS
    
    Project was created by using create-react-app and redux. I used routes on my 
    site and state is managed by redux which made communication between components 
    much easier. Additionally, the project was written in TypeScript because I want 
    to add typing and interfaces to stabilize the code. 


The project is not ready yet, so new functionalities will be added as well as code improvements
